# fetal_health_models

In this notebook, I'm developing classification models for a dataset, given in tabular data form.

Specifically, I will develop classification models to assess the health of a fetus
based on characteristics extracted from cardiotocography examinations of pregnant women.

I will use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to examine the dataset, plot some histograms, boxplots and heatmaps, 
and then I will implement classification models and neural networks, in order to train them and predict the fetal health.

Models used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Neural Networks.
